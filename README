### What is it?

Converts Xcode 3 or prior's text macro definitions (.xctxtmacro) into Xcode 4's similar 'snippet' definitions (.codesnippet).

### (Possible) Build Requirements

* Snow Leopard or later.

### How to Use

1. Launch the app.

2. Click a 'Convert' button. (Open panel will appear)

3. Choose a .xctxtmacro file you want to convert.

4. Click 'Open'.

5. Done.

	The app will create a folder with same name, same place as the .xctxtmacro file you've chosen.
	
	Then places .codesnippet files each are corresponding to one text macro definition.
	
	Put those files into ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets, and relaunch the Xcode 4.
	
Enjoy!
